CSS3 experiments
=================

Public storage for some CSS3 demos I have put together.

Knockout JS - Linear partition seemless gallery
------
Demo of a linear partition algorithm being used to create a dynamic & seamless gallery layout. Responds to changes in screen width and supports dynamic addition of pages.

Currently being fed random content via a flickr API.

Knockout JS - 3D Parallax pointing at mouse
------
Demo with knockoutJS and CSS3 to take the mouse position and point the header images towards the mouse, results in a 3d parallax depth effect with pure CSS.

CSS3 - 3D Cube with shadowing
------
Testing out simulated semi-realistic soft shadowing below a cube

Depth of Field
------
Basic demo of simulated DOF using divs with different "depths", using webkit blur filters to simulate the depth.
