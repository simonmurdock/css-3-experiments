CSS3 experiments
=================

Public storage for some CSS3 demos I have put together.

3D Cube with shadow
------
Simulated semi-realistic soft shadowing below a cube

3D Parallax
------
Demo with knockoutJS and CSS3 to take the mouse position and point the header images towards the mouse, results in a 3d parallax depth effect with pure CSS & JS.

Depth of Field
------
Basic demo of simulated DOF using divs with different "depths", using webkit filters to simulate the blur.
